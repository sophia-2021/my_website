## Visualizing excess monthly and weekly rentals of TfL bikes

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
```

We will us TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day to analyse the average monthly and weekly deviation from a three year average. We use year 2016-2019 to calculate the combarable monthly and weekly average and then plot the actual monthly and weekly average from 2016-present against that comparable average line. We can get the latest data by running the following:

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

First, we focus on the monthly rentals and plot the excess rentals (expected-actual rentals) faceted by year. The green coloring signals that in a particular time period there was more demand than anticipated while red means that there was less. 

```{r montly change in bikes , fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, fig.align= "center"}

# Calculate monthly bike change 
monthly_expected_rentals <- bike %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2016,2017,2018,2019)) %>%  
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(expected_rentals=mean(bikes_hired))

# Calculate actual monthly rentals mean
monthly_actual_rentals <- bike %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021)) %>%  
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarize(actual_rentals=mean(bikes_hired))

df <- inner_join(monthly_expected_rentals, monthly_actual_rentals) %>% 
  mutate(up = case_when((actual_rentals - expected_rentals) > 0 
                        ~ actual_rentals - expected_rentals, 
                        (actual_rentals - expected_rentals) <= 0 
                        ~ 0), 
         down = case_when((expected_rentals - actual_rentals) > 0 
                        ~ expected_rentals - actual_rentals, 
                        (expected_rentals - actual_rentals) <= 0 
                        ~ 0))
# Create the graph
ggplot(df, aes(month, expected_rentals, group=1)) +
  geom_line(color="blue") +
  geom_line(aes(month, actual_rentals)) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 5)) +
  ylim(15000, 45000) +
  
  #Filling of graph 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=expected_rentals,ymax=expected_rentals+up), 
              fill="#7DCD85",
              alpha=0.4) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=expected_rentals,
                  ymax=expected_rentals-down), 
              fill="#CB454A",
              alpha=0.4) +
  
  theme_minimal() + 
  
  #Label the graph 
  labs(
    title = "Monthly changes in TfL bik rentals",
    subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue
and calculated between 2016-2019",
    caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store",
    x = "",
    y = "Bike rentals") +
  NULL

```

Secondly, we look at the weekly average rentals. We shade the graph to signal the different quaters of a year. Additionally, we here look at percentage change from the expected level of weekly rentals rather than the absolute number of rentals as before. 

````{r weekly change in bikes, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10, fig.align= "center" }

# Calculate weekly bike change average
weekly_expected_rentals <- bike %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2016,2017,2018,2019)) %>%  
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarize(expected_rentals=mean(bikes_hired))

# Calculate actual weekly bike change average
weekly_actual_rentals <- bike %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021)) %>%  
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  summarize(actual_rentals=mean(bikes_hired))

df1 <- inner_join(weekly_expected_rentals, weekly_actual_rentals) %>% 
  mutate(change = 100 * (actual_rentals - expected_rentals) / expected_rentals, 
         up = case_when(change > 0 
                        ~ change, 
                        change <= 0 
                        ~ 0), 
         down = case_when(change > 0 
                        ~ 0, 
                        change <= 0 
                        ~ change), 
         type = case_when(down == 0 ~ "up",
                          up == 0 ~ "down"))

# Create the graph
ggplot(df1[1:292,], aes(week, change, group=1)) +
  
  #Create gray background
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=13,xmax=26),
            ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf, fill="#E5E7E9", alpha=0.035) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=39,xmax=53),
            ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf, fill="#E5E7E9", alpha=0.035) +
  geom_line() +
  
  #Create filling between graph 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=up),fill="#7DCD85",alpha=0.4) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=down),fill="#CB454A",alpha=0.4) +
  
  #Create tickmarks at the side and set their color 
  geom_rug(aes(color=type), sides = "b", 
           length = unit(0.04, "npc"), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#CB454A", "#7DCD85"))+
  
  #Facet, change theme and set scale 
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = c("-50%","0%","50%","100%")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(13,26,39,53), 
                   labels = c("13","26","39","53")) +
  
  #Label graph

    title = "Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals",
    subtitle = "%change from weekly averages
