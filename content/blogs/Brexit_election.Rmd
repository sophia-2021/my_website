## Analysis of Brexit voting results broked down by political affiliation 

Using data manipulation and visualization skills, we use the Brexit results data to analyze the relationship between political affiliation and tendency of voting in favor of leaving the EU during the Brexit Referendum. 

The data comes from [Elliott Morris](https://www.thecrosstab.com/), who cleaned it and made it available through his [DataCamp class on analysing election and polling data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r).

The main outcome variable (or y) is `leave_share`, which is the percent of votes cast in favor of Brexit, or leaving the EU. Each row is a UK [parliament constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies).

# Load the data and skim it 
First we load the data and explore it to get a feeling for the different variables. 
```{r brexit graph, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Load data
brexit <- read_csv(here::here("data", "brexit_results.csv"))

# Inspect data
glimpse(brexit)
skim(brexit)
```

# Crete long format of data and plot 
Next, we transform the data frame into the long format by assigning the party names to a new name **Party** using `pivot_longer()`. This makes it more efficient to plot the graph in the next step. We use `scale_color_manual()` to set the colors of the line and points to the official party colors. The official colors can be find using Google. We then adjust some remaining aesthetics of the graph such as changing the theme, setting the axis limits, and labeling the graph. 
```{r brexit graph 2, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

# Change to long format
brexit_long <- brexit %>%  
  pivot_longer(cols=c('con_2015', 'lab_2015', 'ld_2015', 'ukip_2015'), names_to= "Party", 
               values_to="Party_share") 
  
# Plot graphs group/colour based on party   
ggplot(data=brexit_long, aes(x=Party_share, y=leave_share, group=Party, colour=Party)) +

  # Set colour
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#0087dc", "#d50000", "#FDBB30", "#EFE600"), 
                     breaks = c('con_2015', 'lab_2015', 'ld_2015', 'ukip_2015'),
                     labels = c("Conservative", "Labour", "Lib Dems", "UKIP"))+
 
  # Set transparency, smooth line, themes, and x/y axis 
  geom_point(alpha=0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  theme_minimal() + 
  ylim(c(20,100))+
  xlim(c(0,90))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,20,40,60,80))+
  
  #Adjust legend and build border 
  theme(legend.position="bottom", 
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_rect(color = "black",
                                    fill = NA,
                                    size = 1))+
  # Change labeling of graph
  labs(
    title = "How political affiliation translated to Brexit Voting",
    x = "Party % in the UK 2015 general election",
    y = "Leave % in the 2016 Brexit referendum", 
    cex=0.1)
  
```


## Observations
Looking at the graph, it is easy to see that the different political parties have different relationships with the percentage of leave voting in the Brexit referendum. For example, the percentage of *UKIP* in the general election appears to have a much stronger positive relationship, while percentage of *Lib Dems* in the general election appears to have a slight negative relationship to the percentage of leave voting. Hence, political party affiliation seems to be a valid indicator of likelihood to vote in favor of Brexit.
