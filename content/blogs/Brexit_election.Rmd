## Analysis of Brexit voting results broked down by political affiliation 

Using data manipulation and visualization skills, we use the Brexit results data frame and produce a plot. With this graph we can analysis the relationship between political affiliation than tendency of voting in favor of leaving the EU. 

The data comes from [Elliott Morris](https://www.thecrosstab.com/), who cleaned it and made it available through his [DataCamp class on analysing election and polling data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r).

The main outcome variable (or y) is `leave_share`, which is the percent of votes cast in favour of Brexit, or leaving the EU. Each row is a UK [parliament constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies).

# Load the data and skim it 
```{r brexit graph, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
# Load data
brexit <- read_csv(here::here("data", "brexit_results.csv"))

# Inspect data
glimpse(brexit)
skim(brexit)
```

# Crete long format of data and plot 
```{r brexit graph 2, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

# Change to long format
brexit_long <- brexit %>%  
  pivot_longer(cols=c('con_2015', 'lab_2015', 'ld_2015', 'ukip_2015'), names_to= "Party", 
               values_to="Party_share") 
  
# Plot graphs group/colour based on party   
ggplot(data=brexit_long, aes(x=Party_share, y=leave_share, group=Party, colour=Party)) +

  # Set colour

                     breaks = c('con_2015', 'lab_2015', 'ld_2015', 'ukip_2015'),
                     labels = c("Conservative", "Labour", "Lib Dems", "UKIP"))+
