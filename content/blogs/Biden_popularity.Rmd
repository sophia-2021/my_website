# Analysis of President Biden's popularity over time 

In this section, we will visualize President Biden's approval rate since his first day in office at the beginning of 2021. We will load the data from fivethirtyeight.com as it has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
```

## Load the data 

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_pollist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_pollist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_pollist <- approval_pollist %>% 
  mutate(modeldate = lubridate::mdy(modeldate), 
         startdate = lubridate::mdy(startdate), 
          enddate = lubridate::mdy(enddate), 
          createddate = lubridate::mdy(createddate))
```

## Create a plot

We calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since President Biden got into office. Then we plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. We use the 'enddate' as date and facet by the subgroup to see the difference between adults, voters and all polls. 

```{r Bidens Approval Margins, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.align= "center"}

# Create confidence levels
approval_margins <- approval_pollist %>%
  
  #Select enddate
  filter(!is.na(enddate)) %>%
  mutate(week=isoweek(enddate)) %>%
  
  #Group the data
  group_by(week, subgroup) %>%
  
  #Summarize data (use se formula for differences)
  summarise(
    number = n(),
    net_approval_rate = mean(adjusted_approve)-mean(adjusted_disapprove),
    sd_approve = sd(adjusted_approve),
    sd_disapprove = sd(adjusted_disapprove),
    se = sqrt((sd_approve)**2/number+((sd_disapprove)**2/number)),
    t_critical=qt(0.975, number- 1 ),
            lower = net_approval_rate- (t_critical*se),
            upper = net_approval_rate+ (t_critical*se))

glimpse(approval_margins)

#Create the graph
approval_margins  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=week, y=net_approval_rate)) +
  
  #Set colors 
  geom_point(color="chocolate2", size=1) +
  geom_line(color="chocolate2")+
  
  #Add fill between lines
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower, ymax=upper),
              color="chocolate2", 
              fill="grey87", 
              linetype=1, 
              alpha=0.5, 
              size=0.3) +
  
  #Change limits, theme, scale, facet wrap and add fitted line 
  ylim(c(-15,50)) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 35, 13))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-15, 10, 2.5))+
  facet_wrap(~subgroup)+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  
  #Add horizontal line 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, 
             linetype="solid",
             color = "chocolate2", 
             size=1) +
  
  #Add labels 
  labs( caption= "Source: fivethirtyeight.com ",
        title= "Estimating Approval Margins (approve-disapprove) for Joe Biden",
        subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
        x = "Week of the year",
        y = "Average Approval Margin (approve-disapprove") +
  NULL
    
```

## Analysis 
Looking at the confidence interval, we can see that its size greatly differ between week 4 and week 25. One of the reasons for this is that the sample set size differs between week 4 and week 25. The sample size on week 4 is much smaller than that of week 25 which is why the standard error is relatively higher in week 4. This leads to larger confidence intervals in week 4 compared to week 25.
As far as the data across the weeks is concerned, as sample size increases - confidence intervals shrink. The approval ratings for Joe Biden have reduced between week 4 and 25.
